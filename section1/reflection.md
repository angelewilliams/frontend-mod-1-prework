## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  I already do my best to prioritize eating healthy whole foods, and I would add that getting sleep is important for taking care of your brain. I resonated with the grow mindset and viewing learning as a process. Admittedly, this is hard for me at times when I get stuck and or frustrated, but I hope to return to those concepts sooner.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  We learned about string, boolean and number data types.
  * String is a data type that represents text or a collection of alphabet, numeric or special characters. They can contain spaces as well. Strings must be in single or double quotation marks, as long as they are consistent in line of code.
  * Number is a data type that in other languages is often separated into 'integers,' which are whole numbers, positive or negative, and 'floats,' which are numbers that contain decimal points, also positive or negative. In JavaScript, integers and floats are conisdered the 'number' data type.
  *Boolean is a data type where the value is either true or false. They help leverage boolean logic, used in algebra for creating true false statements.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  One way I would log the string above is to write the following code:
  ```javascript
   var greeting = "Hello World!";
   console.log(greeting);
  ```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  To indicate comments in a JavaScript file, which has the file extension '.js' you can either use two backslashes '//' for a single line comment at the beginning of the line or you can use one backslash and asterisk at the beginning and an asterisk and backslash at the end for '/* your code comments here */ multiple lines of comment or code that you want the JavaScript interpreter to ignore.
    Code comments are for briefly describing what code does so that another developer can understand what you are trying to accomplish. You can also use code comments to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore lines of code if you are testing something.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  A variable is kind of like a secret code you have with the computer. You could create a variable that was called favoriteColor and then tell the computer what that is, maybe it's blue right now. So if you asked, "Hey computer, what's my favoriteColor?" it would tell you blue! If you change your mind though, you can change update the variable, favoriteColor to orange so that it knows your current favorite is actually orange and not blue anymore.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  I use cooking.nytimes.com and I would assume that they might use variables similar to these:
``` javascript
var recipeSaved = true;
var savedRecipes = 212;
var firstName = "Angele"
```
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  Concatenation is a way to join two or more strings, or other data types and return a string. It is a helpful way to return multiple strings and and variables into one output.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
  I would think that Facebook uses concatenation to combine the different notification types into one summary number that indicates you have unseen content.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  * What are the key differentiators between when to use concatenation versus interpolation?
  * How does the unseen (by the user) collection of data inform the variables on a website?
  * What are best practices in terms of reassigning variables? Is there a reason you wouldn't edit the original phrase of assignment in the first place?  
  * Is there a golden rule for variable name assignment? Does it become more obvious with time?
  * Is there a way to see all of the variables you've assigned in one place or via console log as kind of a reference?
  * What is the most common mistake with data type attribution?
