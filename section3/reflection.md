## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * The acronym S.M.A.R.T. stood out to me as a good practice to reintroduce. Taking more time to define and set goals that are: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.
  * Remembering that I can improve with effort and practice. In the past I've been self conscious of my technical skills and I would like to reframe my narrative that I can get better and grow into the skills I am interested in cultivating, even if they do not feel natural at first.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * Currently I practice reflecting on the process, evaluating what's working well and what isn't and can almost always find something to tweak or improve upon.
  * Where I am _not_ demonstrating a growth mindset is comparing myself to others. Sometimes I find it hard to recognize my own progress and continue without self-judgement.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * I use Todoist, and I would assume that the names of lists and likely the lists themselves could use arrays to store the data I input via the user interface.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * An array method is function that can be applied to our arrays to manipulate the array by performing a change or calculation. Like commands in the terminal some are informative and give you feedback about the array, others are additive, some remove and get more advanced from there.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * Loops are there to perform an action a 'n' number of times, determined by the author of the code. Since you only have to write a given loop once and can then apply it many times, Loops can keep your codebase cleaner and easier to edit.
  Loops can be used with arrays to perform an action on each item in that given array/collection which is very helpful for displaying complex

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * Loops are a way to repeat an action until you think it's enough. If you needed to put your toys away, you might repeat the action of finding a toy, picking it up and putting it in your toy box, you would do that for the number of toys that we out, until everything was nicely put away. You can do the same kind of thing with code. Repeat the same action to a collection of things, like your collection of toys, until you're done with the task that you want to accomplish.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * Is it obvious if you accidentally create and "infinite loop" and you break your script? Are there any common times this happens?
  * Are there common mistakes when people use an array but should be using another data type, or is it usually the other way around?
  * What is a use case for having an array with multiple different data types as the elements?
  * Are there similar functions to loops to iterate multiple times, or do loops just get more advanced?
