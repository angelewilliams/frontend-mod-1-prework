## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * I felt more pressure to get stuff done in the short period of time. I think overall I was able to get into a rhythm most of the time but definitely adjust the amount of time depending on what I was working on.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * I did find it easier to focus on the main task I intended to focus on and usually after the first shorter period of time, I was able to adjust larger sections if I really wanted to dig in and not break ever 25 minutes.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  * Objects are a way to store data. They are not indexed, like an Array is so you can treat it more like a database than a numbered list.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - If you were just making a list of names, I think an array makes sense here, because you it would be a list of strings and is generally a straight forward ask.
  * List of states and their capitals - Probably an object since you could create `State` as an object and the store 'name' and 'capital' as properties within it.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - I would use an object because you could more easily have different types of data, include numbers of certain items sort them by the trip you are going on.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - I'm inclined to say array since it is one piece of information you are collecting and displaying.
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object, so that you can utilize properties for 'name' and 'cohort'
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object, each ingredient could be a property and the amounts could be the property values. Also you could create a method to double, half, triple etc. the recipe.
  * All my favorite restaurants - because you probably don't want the name, I think an Object so that you can use properties for helpful information like location, cuisine and favorite menu items.  

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
  * Spotify likely has an object that collects listening data over the course of the year which they display to you as your "Spotify Wrapped" experience in app which shows you minutes listened, top artists, top songs, etc. 
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  * I'm feeling a bit unsure about my answers to the questions above about when to use an array or an object. After focusing on objects, it seems like most real world situations would use objects and then array data type within it. Will we be going over this more in Mod1?
  * Can/How do you leverage loops within objects?
